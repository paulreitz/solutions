# Solutions
While working on various projects, I often encounter what I feel should be fairly common problems. However, when investigating these problems, I often find there are no solutions, or people are recommending bad solutions, or solutions that simply do not work.

So I've created this repo as a sort of one stop notebook of problems I've encountered and the solutions I've found. Partly so I can refer back to the solutions again, and also so that others who may encounter the same problems can benefit from my work.
