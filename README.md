# Solutions
While working on various projects, I often encounter what I feel should be fairly common problems. However, when investigating these problems, I often find there are no solutions, or people are recommending bad solutions, or solutions that simply do not work.

So I've created this repo as a sort of one stop notebook of problems I've encountered and the solutions I've found. Partly so I can refer back to the solutions again, and also so that others who may encounter the same problems can benefit from my work.

# Contents:
## [create-react-app](create-react-app.md):

Ways to modify different configurations that are "black boxed" by `create-react-app`, **without** the need to use `eject`.

## [React and Electron](react-electron.md):

Front end issues when working with electron, specifically related to React.
